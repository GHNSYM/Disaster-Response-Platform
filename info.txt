üö® Disaster Response Platform: Feature Overview
Key Features
Disaster Creation & Management
Users can create new disaster events by entering a title, description, and tags.
The system automatically extracts the location from the description using AI, geocodes it, and stores it as a spatial point in the database.
All disasters are listed with real-time updates via Socket.IO.
Resource Mapping
For each disaster, users can view nearby resources (shelters, medical, food, etc.) on an interactive OpenStreetMap-based map.
Social Media Feed
Aggregates and displays relevant social media posts for each disaster, providing situational awareness.
Image Verification
Users can submit image URLs for AI-powered verification, checking authenticity and relevance to the disaster context.
Official Updates Aggregation
A dedicated side card fetches and displays the latest official updates from:
NDMA India
Modern, Responsive UI
Built with Bootstrap 5 and Leaflet for a clean, mobile-friendly experience.
‚ö° How Cursor AI Accelerated Development
Rapid API Prototyping: Used Cursor AI to quickly scaffold and refactor Express.js controllers, services, and routes for disaster, resource, and verification management.
AI-Powered Integration: Leveraged Cursor AI to integrate and debug third-party APIs (e.g., Google Gemini, Supabase, RSS feeds) and to automate repetitive code tasks.
Error Handling & Debugging: Used Cursor AI‚Äôs code search and context tools to instantly trace and fix bugs, optimize database schema usage, and ensure robust error handling.
Frontend-Backend Sync: Cursor AI helped align frontend fetch calls and backend route registration, ensuring seamless data flow and real-time updates.
Result: Built a scalable, full-stack disaster response platform with advanced features in a fraction of the usual development time.
üåê Third-Party APIs & Services Used
Supabase
Managed database (PostgreSQL with PostGIS)
Google Gemini (Generative AI)
For extracting locations from disaster descriptions and verifying images.
OpenStreetMap & Leaflet
For interactive mapping and resource visualization.
RSS Feeds
NDMA India: Sachet NDMA RSS
Socket.IO

APIs Using Mock Data
1. Social Media Feed
Source: Mock data (not real social media APIs).
Details: The social media feed for each disaster is generated using hardcoded or simulated posts. No actual integration with Twitter, Facebook, or Bluesky is active by default.
Purpose: Provides example posts for demo and UI purposes, ensuring the feature works even without real API keys or rate limits.
